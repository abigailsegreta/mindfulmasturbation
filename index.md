*Mindful masturbation* is the practice of self-pleasure while practicing _mindfulness_, which means you intentionally focus on the sensations you experience in the moment, drawing your focus into your body and senses[^mindfulness-def]. Masturbation to sleep, relax, or relieve sexual tension is lovely, but it can be so much more! Mindful masturbation can be a gateway not just to better pleasure and more powerful orgasms but radical self-love and confidence within your physical and sexual being.

This guide will consolidate mindful masturbation tips and ideas from around the web in one easy guide to getting started with a better way to get off!

  Masturbation is very personal and every human is different. While this site tries to offer helpful tips to get started with mindful masturbation, not everything suggested might work for you. That's okay! If something isn't for you, don't do it -- you're not broken or weird, you're only part of humanity's wonderful spectrum of sexuality! ðŸ¤—

## Goals

Mindful masturbation seeks:
* Connection over habit
  * Engaging with your body and mind makes masturbation a special occasion
* Exploration over conclusions[^mashable-article-mindful]
  * Mindful masturbation is a time for discovering and relishing your body and what you can do with it; questions and experimentation are normal
* Pleasure over orgasm
  * Mindful orgasms are powerful (and longer[^mashable-article-mindful-graphic]) but the goal of the experience is pleasure; the journey, not the destination, is what matters
* Patience over efficiency
  * Our favorite porn and a great vibrator can be powerful stress reducers but efficiency can come at the cost of creativity and awareness[^bloodandmilk]

## Before You Begin

Your chosen space should be somewhere comfortable for your body and mind[^mashable-article-trauma]. A bed is a great choice; if you're a more visual person and the thought of masturbating in front of a mirror is intriguing, put down a soft blanket and pillows. You may feel the urge to moan or make noise as you masturbate, so having an environment where you feel comfortable with that can be helpful -- the goal is to be uninhibited by your surroundings, whether they be physical, interpersonal, or mental. Think about temperature as well -- you might want a heater if you won't be under covers or clothes.

We carry the stress of our day and inhibitions of daily life with us into a session of self love; minimizing stressors and emptying your mind of the day as much as possible before beginning is helpful[^shape-mindblowing]. This may look different for different people -- here are some ideas:
* Take a bubble bath with some gentle essential oils and candles to help relieve tension
* Tidy up your space to feel more at peace with your surroundings
* Practice [diaphragmatic breathing](https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-breathe-with-your-belly-89853) for a few minutes to slow your body down
* Meditate or journal to help quiet your mind and release any anxieties or thoughts running through your head

You might also want to put on some music to get you in the mood -- anything from Chopin to singing bowls to sexy slow jams and everything in between is great! Whatever puts your mind in a sexy mood.

Set aside a block of time when you'll have no other obligations or things to take care of; half an hour can be a great starting point.

## Basics

**SLOW. DOWN.**[^mashable-article-trauma]<sup>, </sup>[^shape-howto]

The core of mindful masturbation is to **tune in and be present** to how different physical sensations and thoughts make you feel while you're getting off. When you move quickly it becomes harder or impossible to focus on the tiny nuances you can experience. Move slowly and attentively.

A great place to start is with a body scan -- get naked, close your eyes, breathe deeply, and relax. Bring awareness to your body, slowly scanning from the tip of your head to your toes. What sensations do you notice? Do you feel the pressure of your body on the bed or floor? Is there anywhere that aches or itches? Are you holding tension in your neck, your shoulders, your jaw, your core? These aren't bad things; pain or tension or sensations you may not be able to name are natural and okay. Notice the feeling of your chest expanding as you breathe; feel your heartbeat gently rocking your chest. If you find a sensation curious, dwell on it for a few moments before moving elsewhere in your body. Be open and forgiving with your body as you take it in, especially if this is the first time you've tried something like this! It's also alright if you find your mind drifting to other worries or concerns -- gently guide your focus back to your body until you've examined everything you want to[^body-scan].

It can be helpful to start your touch with a slow self massage which will help you relax and engage with your body. Use a similar sort of attention as the body scan to guide your touch. Use different types of touch in different places. For example, you may firm finger work to release tight shoulders or scalp muscles; soft tickles across your chest; gentle scratches or pinches on inner thighs; gliding pressure across your belly -- these are just suggestions; touch where and how feels pleasant and interesting to you. You can also explore more unusual touch such as using more powerful vibrators (such as a Hitachi Magic Wand or similar) to give your body deep vibrations through your chest or even through your forehead[^caitlin-roberts-video]. Remember to stay in tune with what you're feeling; be patient with your feelings and soak in the sensations.

## Sexual Touch

Slowly let your hands move to more sexual areas. No two people's erogenous zones are the same so let your touch wander.

**Be playful with yourself[^caitlin-roberts-video]!** Rather than moving right to your typical method for masturbation, bring your attention to the sensation of different kinds of touch. For example, instead of touching your clit, try massaging your labia or pubic bone; instead of going for your G-spot, try playing with your perineum or the back wall of your vagina. If you have a penis, try massaging around the base of your shaft or perineum.

When you're touching yourself, continue to experiment with types ways of contact[^surry-hills-therapy] -- try stroking, tapping, kneading, deep pressure, tickling, or even spanking. Even if a touch doesn't immediately feel pleasurable, keep your mind on the feeling of your skin and the way the touch feels. You can also try switching things up by using your non-dominant hand[^shape-howto] or both hands, or doing familiar motions but far more slowly than usual.

Remember to keep your breathing deep and regular, and very importantly **feel free to make noise!** You might feel the urge to moan or be breathy when you're doing self massage; lean into it! Society can make moaning or noise into a shameful thing but it's a beautiful way to express pleasure. Don't feel constrained by problematic gender norms either -- if you identify as more feminine, it's okay to growl and grunt; if you identify as masculine it's okay to mewl or coo. Let go of society's inhibitions and feel every bit of your delicious pleasure!

## Headspace

As continually mentioned, the goal is to **experience pleasure**: be present for the sensations your body gives you and try to make your goal feeling good, not having an orgasm. Look for the pleasure in what you're doing; even if a motion doesn't seem to be immediately lovely, observe the sensation and how your body reacts to it.

Shame about the physical appearance of our bodies can be a powerful negative force. Try to take your body as it is; thank it for its ability to feel pleasure and for being an amazing, intricate vessel for your mind and soul. If positive body image is something you struggle with, verbal affirmations before or during your masturbation time can be powerful; masturbation while watching yourself in a mirror can also be a radical act of presence with your physical self.

If you feel drawn into a certain headspace or mood as you masturbate, embrace it! Sometimes you might feel small, submissive, and gentle; other times you might feel strong, powerful, and dominant. You may even enjoy repeating a mantra as you masturbate such as "I'm so strong," "My body is beautiful," or "I'm delicious!"

Fantasies can be very powerful during masturbation as well. While mindful masturbation is primarily about being present in your own body, fantasies are still wonderful and you should indulge in them! Give yourself permission for the inside of your head to be a safe garden just for you; your fantasies are yours and yours alone. Fantasies about past lovers are normal and even healthy[^menshealth]. Don't let your fantasies get tangled up with shame because of societal, religious, or family reasons -- let your mind go where it wants to; your body will thank you for it!

## Orgasm and Afterwards

Orgasms themselves are not necessarily the exclusive goal of mindful masturbation. That being said, orgasms during mindful masturbation are often more powerful and longer than during typical masturbation[^mashable-article-mindful-graphic]. If you do orgasm, let it wash over you and indulge in it like a delicious dessert! Take your time and give yourself permission to feel and be present for every last moment of it. You can also experiment with new ways of orgasming -- for example, if you usually hold your breath as you cum, try breathing deeply as it washes over you. If you usually tense up, try relaxing into it; if you usually stay relaxed, try engaging your core or legs as you begin to cum.

Give yourself conscious permission to let your body go wild! Moaning, screaming, and even crying or having trouble speaking are okay and exciting expressions of pleasure! Listen to your body and do what it wants you to do even if it's not something you typically do; mindful masturbation can produce powerful pleasure and experiencing it how your body wants to is important.

Aftercare for yourself is also important! Society often deems an orgasm the end of a sexual experience but it doesn't have to be during mindful masturbation. Softly examine what you and your body is asking for after an orgasm; there is no "normal". You might feel at peace, calm or even sleepy; you might be energized and aware or you might want to sit with your emotions or even have a good cry. Let your emotions flow out if they need to. Maybe your body is asking for more pleasure! Even if you don't typically have multiple orgasms, you can still keep giving yourself pleasure with massage, more genital stimulation, or even just reveling in the feeling of soft blankets and pillows on your skin. You'll grow more attuned with your body as you practice this mindfulness.

## Toys

For most people, everything you need to have amazing mindful self-love is built into your own body! Fingers are a great, sense-filled tool to explore yourself with. However, some people may have unique anatomical or physical needs, or are ready to experiment with new methods of pleasure, and that can be a great time for sex toys to help. Since toys are not the main focus of mindful masturbation, they've got their own page.

## Troubleshooting

Mindful masturbation and meaningful self-pleasure are experiments, and sometimes experiments don't go exactly right. Engaging deeply with yourself and your body can lead to trauma of various kinds surfacing. Sometimes embodiment and mindfulness can help move through these; other times some professional help is needed. Don't push into mindfulness if you're in a place where it's harmful to you. Seek some help and return to mindfulness if and when it's a healthy endeavor for you.

Self-image and body issues, imposed by society or ourselves, can also rear their head when we focus intimately on our physical self. There are a variety of ways to grow a love for your body, including using mindful masturbation to help you internalize how wonderful your body is and how fantastic it can make you feel. However, there are also avenues ranging from self affirmation and personal gratitude practices to therapy or counseling that can help build self-love.

Some may find it difficult to sexually stimulate their body at all. This can stem from a wide range of causes but is almost certainly not as uncommon or strange as you may think it is. Researching online or speaking with a therapist can help you feel less alone and provide ideas and steps for how to work on and through this, if you desire. Mindful masturbation might also be helpful if it's not something you've attempted before, although your mileage may vary and working with someone you trust is most likely to be a helpful way forward. Most importantly, you're not broken -- all humans have a unique path to pleasure to walk.

Physical disabilities can cause difficulty with masturbation due to a variety of reasons. Advocacy and support groups may be able to provide information and tips on masturbation relevant to different situations; toys and body supports of different kinds may help as well. Mindful masturbation or sexual massage can also be possible with a receptive partner or sex worker as alternative options.

In some cases, a partner might express emotions ranging from curiosity to concern with an exercise such as mindful masturbation. Hopefully you can remind your partner that masturbation is normal and healthy. In some cases, it may help to remind them that being in touch with your own body and desires can make you a more full sexual being including in sexual activities with them. You may even want to invite your partner to read this information and perhaps try mindful masturbation for themselves!

## Closing

Masturbation and sexuality are wonderful things, and mindful masturbation can help you be in touch with the fullness of sexuality and pleasure your body can provide you. This guide is only a starting point; lifelong learning and education is important! Ask good questions, find your own answers, and most importantly, may you have bountiful and delicious sexual pleasure alone, with others, and always!
