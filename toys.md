# Toys

Toys can be a fantastic way to enhance masturbation once you have learned what you can do with your hands and body alone. Because toys are coming into contact with intimate parts your body, it's important to do research and only buy toys that are high quality and safe for your body. Always buy from trusted vendors!

This guide is only the barest of introductions to a wide, wide world of toys. Research on your own will open up a massive variety of options, so don't limit yourself to the basics mentioned here!

## Clitoral Stimulation

Vibrators have been such a durable stalwart of sex toys for a reason. A *bullet vibrator* (a gently tapered cylinder) is a great and simple starting point and can do double duty for G-spot or vaginal stimulation. *Wand vibrators* can be more aggressive and allow for more powerful stimulation and can also be used for body massage.

*Suction toys* are a newer type of clitoral stimulation that use a seal and pulsing suction to stimulate the clitoris; some say that the sensation is analogous to oral stimulation from a partner.

There are also more exotic form factors such as combination G-spot/clitoral vibrators (sometimes called *rabbit* vibrators for the rubber "bunny ears" that surround the clit), textured or shaped vibrators to emulate a tongue or other body parts, and finger vibrators which attach to your hand to provide the dexterity of your fingers with an extra vibrating bonus.

## G-Spot & Vaginal Stimulation

Vibrators for the G-spot are by far the most common toy for stimulation of that area. There's a wide range of dildos that can also be used for non-moving stimulation. Rabbit vibrators will sometimes have rotating beads within the dildo but underneath the membrane to mechanically stimulate the G-spot and vagina.

Dildos also come in a variety of sizes if the sensation of being stretched or filled is appealing. For more exotic interests, dildos in the form of animal, monster, or even alien penises are available.

## Anal Stimulation

Most importantly, all anal-use toys *must* have a flared base! Using toys without a flared base is dangerous because they can slip inside you and become impossible to remove without medical intervention. Going slow and using plenty of lubricant is also vital for safe anal play; insufficient lubrication can cause tears that can increase the likelihood of infection or even STI transmission during sex with a partner.

The world of anal toys is massive and varied. Small butt plugs can be a way to get used to the sensation of having something inserted in your ass; they often come in sets that allow you to increase in size as you become used to the stimulation and learn to relax. Anal beads provide slightly more active stimulation and can also be a great beginner toy.

Vibrators and dildos of all shapes and sizes abound; there are even toys that enter the anus and vagina simultaneously and stimulate the clitoris too.

For owners of a prostate, there are vibrators as well as manual toys in various finishes and materials which are specifically angled to stimulate the prostate. There are also butt plugs with perineal stimulators which can provide additional sensation.

## Penis Stimulation

Masturbators that emulate various orifices are among the most common toys for people with penises; they come in various shapes and sizes.

Cock rings increase the retention of blood in the penis which can cause harder erections and increase sensation, although care must be taken to not occlude blood flow -- know how to remove your ring in case of circulation issues and discuss with a doctor if you have any medical conditions that may interfere with safe use of a cock ring.

Some cock rings may vibrate, although the stimulation is often intended more for a partner than the wearer. For vibration, options range from vibrating masturbators to static sleeves that fit over the shaft or glans and attach to a larger vibrator to provide motion.

Some new toys also feature mechanical stimulation through a sleeve to emulate the sensation of penetrative or oral sex.

## Nipple Stimulation

Nipple clamps are the perennial standby for nipple stimulation; depending on tightness and material the effects can range from light pressure to a very hard pinch. Some even vibrate or allow for the addition of weights for additional pressure.

Pressure/suction-based clitoral stimulators can also be used on the nipples, as can passive suction cups for providing a more continuous sucking sensation.

## Lubricant

Personal lubricant can enhance nearly all forms of sexual activity, including masturbation. It can ease the motion of penetrative toys, promote better seals on suction-based stimulators, and generally provide a modified sensation when touching or rubbing.

Lubricants come in a variety of types and the most common are water, silicone, and oil-based. Water-based lubricant is almost always safe for both toys and condoms, though the glide it provides may fade as it dries out. Some "warming" or "numbing" lubricants may irritate the skin, so make sure to test it before use.

Silicone-based lubricant (not silicon) can provide more consistent and long lasting lubrication and is especially suited for anal play, but can cause silicone toys to break down, so only use it with glass or steel toys.

Oil-based lubricants (such as coconut oil) are typically less suited for sexual play. Oil-based lubricants can break down silicone or rubber toys and are also not safe for use with condoms. While oil is safe for external use, its effect on the beneficial microbes and pH balance of human orifices is not well studied so it is not typically advised for penetration. Oil-based lubes will do for external play or penetrative play in a pinch, but professionally manufactured made-for-sexual-activity lubricants are your safest bet.

## Body Modification

This guide would be remiss in not mentioning the pleasurable opportunities body modifications such as piercings can provide. Nipples, labia, clit and clitoral hood, penis head, shaft, scrotum, and even the perineum can be pierced for varying different sensual and aesthetic effects. Piercings can support visually pleasing and sexually stimulating adornments via creative designs and weights and can also be manually stimulated.
